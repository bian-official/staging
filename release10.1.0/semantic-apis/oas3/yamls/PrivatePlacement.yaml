An account will typically group the debit and credit entries for a specific aspect of the business resulting from transactions,\nOften accounts are represented as a T-account which is a visual aid used to depict an account. Above the top portion of the T would be the account title. On the left-side of the base of the T would be any debit amounts; on the right-side would be the credit amounts.\nA commonly used bookkeeping method is the double-entry method. This means that every transaction has at least 2 movements. If a customer pays 100 € in cash, there is\na decrease in the amount that the customer owes to the company (the customer position is decreased)\nan increase in the amount that the company has in cash (the cash position is increased)\n\nAn account can be assigning to one or more ledgers. A ledger is a group of accounts for a certain purpose. If there is need for multiple ledgers because of multiple purpose, an account can perfectly well assigned to multiple ledgers. When Ledgers are in real physical books, this is not possible. When ledgers are digital, accounts can be grouped into multiple groups at the same time. This practice is very rarely taught into courses for accounting, but in digital accounting, it is common practice.\n\nExamples: \nstock account of a shop, cash register, bank account, financial accounting account, customer account, supplier account, ...\nBank Account BE12 1234 5678 9012: is an individual banking account\nAccounts Payable, is a collective account keeping the balance of the amounts to pay by the organisation to its suppliers. The balance is the result of the financial movements related to suppliers. This account is managed usually in a General Ledger \nSupplier Account X, is an individual account keeping the balance of the amounts to pay by the organisation to an individual supplier. The balance is the result of the financial movements related to an individual supplier. This account is managed usually in a sub-ledger.\nStock Account x, is an individual account keeping the balance of the amounts in stock of a specific good.\nA payment service to take fund out of an account.
