The limit represents the maximum amount the indirect participant can use to settle its operations.\r\n* `Global` - Maximum value set by either the transaction administrator or by a member for the participation of a member in the system.

The credit provided can be secured using securities already held by the buyer (“collateral stocks”) or the securities that are being purchased (“collateral flows”).\r\n* `Unsecuredcredit` - Limit is related to a cap amount granted by a national central bank or a settlement bank, but generally unsecured outside of the market infrastructure.\r\n* `Externalguarantee` - Limit is related to a cap amount granted by a national central bank or a settlement bank.\r\n"
